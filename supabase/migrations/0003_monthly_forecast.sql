-- Monthly Monte Carlo forecast runs, written weekly by the Python worker
-- (worker/iris_worker/monthly.py, scheduled in .github/workflows/monthly-forecast.yml).
--
-- One row per run, keyed by the as-of date (the last completed UTC daily close).
-- A retried or duplicated schedule upserts the same row instead of adding one.
-- Older rows are kept on purpose: each run's `realized` column is re-scored by
-- later runs, which is what turns the table into a live out-of-sample record.
--
-- Apply with: supabase db push, or paste into the SQL editor.
